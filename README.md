👋 Hey there! I'm Ons – a curious mind, a code crafter, and a lifelong learner.

💻 Currently diving deep into Computer Engineering and exploring the magic of Data, Cloud & IoT.</br>                                                                            🚀 Passionate about building real-world solutions – from automating daily tasks to crafting smart systems.</br>
🎯 Always up for a new challenge, a hackathon, or just a good coffee-fueled coding session.</br>
🤝 Open to collaboration, internships, and sharing ideas. Let’s connect, build, and grow!</br>
🔧 Tools & Tech I enjoy: Python | SQL | HTML/CSS | JS | MySQL | Linux | Git | Cloud (soon to master 😉)</br>
🌍 I also volunteer with Red Cross & Red Crescent – tech meets heart 💗</br>
