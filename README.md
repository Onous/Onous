##👋 Hey there! I'm Ons – a curious mind, a code crafter, and a lifelong learner.

💻 Currently diving deep into Computer Engineering and exploring the magic of Data, Cloud & IoT.

🚀 Passionate about building real-world solutions – from automating daily tasks to crafting smart systems.

🎯 Always up for a new challenge, a hackathon, or just a good coffee-fueled coding session.

🤝 Open to collaboration, internships, and sharing ideas. Let’s connect, build, and grow!

🔧 Tools & Tech I enjoy: Python | SQL | HTML/CSS | JS | MySQL | Linux | Git | Cloud (soon to master 😉)

🌍 I also volunteer with Red Cross & Red Crescent – tech meets heart 💗
